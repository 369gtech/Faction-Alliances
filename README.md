<h1>Faction-Alliances</h1>

Faction Alliances as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGames-Metaverse-Prologue">Alpha monoGames Metaverse Prologue</a> are United Alliances. So it is a good idea to connect with your your Friendly Alliances because when the game expands there will be special Alliance Battles and Alliance Missions that you will need to join forces to battle, survive and complete missions. Its a fun way for the Factions to build stronger ties with their Real Allies.

As the game expands and we add more blockchain communities to monoGames we will put it to the players, developers and investors to vote how we might expand the game. We might want to a add a new Alliance or we might just want to continue to add those new blockchains to the established teams we already have.
