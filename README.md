<h1>Faction-Alliances</h1>

Faction Alliances as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGames-Metaverse-Prologue">Alpha monoGames Metaverse Prologue</a> are United Alliances. So it is a good idea to connect with your your Friendly Alliances because when the game expands there will be special Alliance Battles and Alliance Missions that you will need to join forces to battle, survive and complete missions. Its a fun way for the Factions to build stronger ties with their Real Allies.

There are 12 <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Factions</a> altogether that will have teams in Destiny Of The Universe. monoGames will reach out to those Blockchain Communities to build their teams of 12 Players, address a Faction Leader, Higher Council Members and Council Members to build a rel functioning team to lead their Blockchain to Greatness in monoGames. 

As these teams are developing we want to build Faction Alliances which will include the Eclipse Alliance (Signum, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain and Koinos), Moon Alliance (Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot and DOGE) and Sun Alliance (Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill) and all Factions will eventually be split into the 12 Constellations Of The Universe subject to the story line of Destiny Of The Universe.
