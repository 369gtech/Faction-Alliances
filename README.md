<h1>Faction-Alliances</h1>

Faction Alliances as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Alpha-monoGames-Metaverse-Prologue">Alpha monoGames Metaverse Prologue</a> are United Alliances. So it is a good idea to connect with your your Friendly Alliances because when the game expands there will be special Alliance Battles and Alliance Missions that you will need to join forces to battle, survive and complete missions.
