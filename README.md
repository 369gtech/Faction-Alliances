<h1>Faction-Alliances</h1>

There are 12 Blockchain <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Factions">Factions</a> (Signum, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, DOGE, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain, Koinos, Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill.) altogether that will have teams in Destiny Of The Universe. These Factions will be split into 3 Alliances for the Greater Wars in the <a href="https://github.com/369gtech/Destiny-Of-The-Universe-Open-Faction-Tournaments">Destiny Of The Universe Open-Faction Tournaments</a> when the game goes into expansion mode. These teams include;

The Signum Faction has been completed as seen below and if you are a Signum Supporter like me, you will see a lot of the Dev's who have and most still do work tirelessly to keep the Signum Blockchain fully functional. These are the Battle Cards that will be used in the Destiny Of The Universe Game because our Developers and Supporters Battle everyday to keep their Blockchain Safe and Number in their Hearts.

For the rest of the Blockchain Factions (Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, DOGE, Pirate Chain, Dragonchain, Koinos, Hive, Wax, BSC and Zill) I will try and leave those communities to choose which 12 Blockchain Members who will be nominated to be part of the Destiny Of The Universe. It is a good idea to connect with your Friendly Alliances because when the game expands there will be special Alliance Battles and Alliance Missions that you will need to join forces to battle, survive and complete for awesome rewards. It's also a fun way for the Factions to build stronger ties with their Real Allies.
